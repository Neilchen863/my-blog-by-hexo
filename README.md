# This is my old personal blog.

It is built by hexo framework, butterfly theme, which is quite user-friendly and suitable for novices to create their blogs.
However, as I decided to post a lot on my blog, about tech and about life, I realized that Hexo cannot meet my demands, since it is 
a bit too slow.

As a result, I made up my mind to transfer to Hugo framework, which is based on the efficient Golang, making it lighter and faster.


According to the data provided by relevant bloggers, it takes 10 minutes to generate static web pages with Hexo for about 200 blog posts, 
while Hugo only takes 10 seconds. From my personal experience, Hugo has indeed greatly accelerated the speed of web page generation. 
It usually takes about 4 seconds to add a blog post and then generate and render it, while Hugo basically completes it within 1 second.

Despite, I would still highly recommend those who would like to create their first blog or website to use Hexo, because it has a better community support.
Even those who know nothing about coding can quickly and easily build a pretty and multifunctional site by simply following the instructions.
